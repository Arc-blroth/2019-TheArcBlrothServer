# 2019-TheArcBlrothServer

An archive of a bad webserver implementation I wrote way back in 2019!

**This is not a good webserver implementation.**
It contains trivial HTML injection bugs, is prone to DDoS attacks, and supports an extremely limited subset of HTTP/1.0.

Nevertheless, TheArcBlrothServer serves as a snapshot of my coding skills from 2019, and a baseline to which you can compare my more recent code to.
